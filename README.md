# Rural_Development_Study_No1
A personal study using government records on if there is any collation between the depopulation of rural counties, and what kind of economic activity that economy engages with. All data was retrived form data.gov. In the end, niether manufacturing nor mining were statistically reveleant to indicate them as the kind of rural economies that lose population at the state level. At around -50% correlation, the ability to maintain a rural population through recration is decently strong. However, the losses from aggricultural development is very strong, at over +75%, indicating a mass migration from farming-dependent areas to other parts of the country. Further inquires can be made into how each sector relate to poverty and educatiion rates, which will probably be amended in the next experiment, if possible.
